# General-portfolio
Continuously updated repository, created in order to demonstrate my general knowledge and experience. Not specific to any language or framework.

## Table of contents
The table of contents is represented in reversed chronological order so that the newest work is listed at the top and the earlier work is listed at the bottom of the contents list. <br>
However, I may update some of my earlier code from time to time. I most likely push the new versions into separate branches and refer to them at least beneath the description of the original code. <br>
For bigger updates I may also create a separate description section.

### 5. [Applesorter (JavaScript and Java, February 2021)](https://github.com/karinjohanson/General-portfolio/tree/main/AppleSorter)

A simple program which sorts the items, in this particular case apples, accordingly to requirements.
Applesorter is written in two different languages: [JavaScript](https://github.com/karinjohanson/General-portfolio/blob/main/AppleSorter/AppleSorter_JavaScript/applesorter.js) and [Java](https://github.com/karinjohanson/General-portfolio/blob/main/AppleSorter/AppleSorter_Java/AppleSorter.java).
No error handling is included at the moment.
In order to illustrate the solution I also created a simple implementation - a [HTML page](https://github.com/karinjohanson/General-portfolio/blob/main/AppleSorter/AppleSorter_JavaScript/AppleSorter_JS_in_HTML.html), whereto on the input field the apple weights can be stated, and the program outputs the stats for them.

### 4. [Number guessing game (JavaScript, January 2021)](https://github.com/karinjohanson/General-portfolio/tree/main/NumberGuessingGame)

A simple program which lets the user guess a (pseudo)randomly generated number between 1 and a certain upper limit which depends on the level the user is on. <br>
After 3 wrong guesses in a row the game is over. <br>
The result is not intended to demonstrate the CSS-skills of the author.

### 3. [Palindrome detector (JavaScript, January 2021)](https://github.com/karinjohanson/General-portfolio/tree/main/Palindrome)

The program checks whether the user input is a palindrome or not.
The result is not intended to demonstrate the CSS-skills of the author.

### 2. [Triangles of numbers (JavaScript, January 2021)](https://github.com/karinjohanson/General-portfolio/blob/main/Triangles_of_numbers.js)

The aim of this program is to create triangles out of numbers into the console using only ONE cycle, whereas the number of conditional statements (if, else if, else) or variables is not limited.

The description of the program is added into the file as a comment.
