# General-portfolio
Continuously updated repository, created in order to demonstrate my general knowledge and experience. Not specific to any language or framework.

## Table of contents

### 1. [Multiplication table (JavaScript, January 2021)](https://github.com/karinjohanson/General-portfolio/blob/main/Multiplication%20table.js)

Prints the multiplication table into the console.
The description of the program is added into the file as a comment.

### 2. [Triangles of numbers (JavaScript, January 2021)](https://github.com/karinjohanson/General-portfolio/blob/main/Triangles_of_numbers.js)

The aim of this program is to create triangles out of numbers into the console using only ONE cycle, whereas the number of conditional statements (if, else if, else) or variables is not limited.

The description of the program is added into the file as a comment.

### 3. [Palindrome detector (JavaScript, January 2021)](https://github.com/karinjohanson/General-portfolio/tree/main/Palindrome)

The program checks whether the user input is a palindrome or not.
The result is not intended to demonstrate the CSS-skills of the author.

### 4. [Applesorter (JavaScript and Java, February 2021)]()
A simple program which sorts the items, in this particular case apples, accordingly to requirements.
Applesorter is written in two different languages: JavaScript and Java.
No error handling is included at the moment.
In order to illustrate the solution I also created a simple implementation - a HTML page, whereto on the input field the apple weights can be stated, and the program outputs the stats for them.
