<!-- 
    The game "Guess the number", allows the user guess the numbers.
    On the first level the numbers are between 1 and 10.
    If the user guesses the number correctly, he gets one point and moves to the second level.
    Next, the game lets the user guess numbers between 1 and 20.
    If the user guesses the number correctly, he gets one more point and moves to the third level.
    Next, the game lets the user guess numbers between 1 and 30 and followed by the same logic, 1-40, 1-50, 1-60 etc.
    Additional requirements for the program:
    On the same level user gets to guess not more than three times. 
    If the user fails to guess three times in row at the same level, the game is over.
    User must see the numbers he already guessed at the same level.
    User must see the score.
    User must see what level is he on.
    When user guessed incorrectly, the program must give the user a hint 
    - is the number greater or smaller than he guessed.
    When the game is over, the user must see, what was the number.
    User must have the chance to start the game over (- a button "Start over" or similar solution).
    All the interaction must take place on the HTML-side. 
    Using JavaScript functions like "alert", "prompt" or "confirm" is not allowed.
